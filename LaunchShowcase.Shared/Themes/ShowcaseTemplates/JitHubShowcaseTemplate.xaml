The one and only &quot;best practice&quot; is to use Web Authentication. As the developer, I have to redirect the user to GitHub's login page on the web, and if and when the user login successfully, I get a code for which I can request an authentication token with. This doesn't sound so hard, but there are a few ways to do it. The first way is to use the WebAuthentication service built into UWP, but that turned out to be a dead end because it's still powered by IE, which GitHub authentication doesn't support any more. Another way is to build a web authentication service myself, which is what CodeHub did. It works, but the UI is not elegant. Furthermore, the users don't get to use their password manager that's normally built into the default browser. This is why JitHub use the browser + protocol redirect to authenticate our users. You don't need to manually enter username and password if you already have logged in with your browser, and you don't need to enter anything into a third-party app to potentially compromise your credentials (not that JitHub is an insecure app, but you get the ease of mind)."/>

JitHub's design philosophy is to give the users the feeling of a code editor like experience when it comes to code viewing. That's why I have a lazy loading enabled file tree on the left side of the code viewer page, but syntax highlighting remains an issue I needed to solve. Initially I looked into how CodeHub does it, and it was really interesting. It uploads the code to a syntax highlighting web service which returns HTML and CSS that gets rendered to a WebView. The HTML and CSS provide the necessary style for the syntax highlighting, and for the most part, it looks alright. I was tempted to use this method as well at the beginning, but I quickly noticed a few drawbacks of this approach. First, it uploads one's code no matter if it's private repo or not. This could be a huge security problem for high profile repos. Secondly, it doesn't work offline, which I plan to support in JitHub in a future build. So, this method is definitely not sustainable. I needed something better, something that's more native and local. I then started to look at what code editor control is available on UWP, but it turns out there's basically no code editor control available for UWP. (There's Monaco for UWP, but it's WebView and so buggy for JitHub's use case) So for initial versions of JitHub, we are only supporting code viewing, and the syntax highlighting is supported by a markdown code block. In JitHub V2, we'll explore some crazy ideas around this area that will bring the code viewing/editing experience 10x better than the current one."/>

So I started to note down all the features and layouts that GitHub web uses and translate them into what would look and feel more like a native UWP app but still maintaining the GitHub DNA. You will notice, when using JitHub, everything feels familiar for both Windows users ang GitHub users.
